## Writing a DSL for the Dense with Scala

###Keywords
DSL, Scala, beginner, readability, business logic

###Session format
Presentation (45 minutes)

###Track
Foundations

###Abstract (max 600 chars)
Sometimes code is cluttered or cumbersome. Sometimes code needs to be readable for Testers or Business Analysts. Sometimes they even need to write the code! Would it not be nice if you could write code that looks almost like natural language? Would it not be cool if it had auto-completion? Would it not be great if you could do it without external DSL tooling like ANTLR? Would it not be awesome if all that is actually really easy?

In DSL for the Dense we will look into the various techniques of writing a clean Domain Specific Language using Scala.

###Required Knowledge 
Some experience with Scala would be nice, but that's it.

###Learning Objectives
Learn: 
- how to write your own DSL,
- how to make it type safe and idiot-proof,
- when to deviate from regular best practices and coding conventions

###BIO (max 500 chars)
####Your bio should be short, no longer than 500 characters. It's related to why you're speaking about this topic.
Code should be readable and elegant, especially when it comes to business logic. At a previous assignment Nathan helped create a DSL that allowed business analysts to write out business logic in working code. He learned Scala's DSL tricks when he was barely a programmer, demonstrating that you do not, in fact, need to be a coding guru to write a good DSL.
Nathan is a software developer at Codestar Ordina and works mostly with Scala, always paying extra attention to readability.
