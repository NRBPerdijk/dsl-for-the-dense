/**

  *
  * The "ExternalApi" used in the "Writing a DSL for the Dense with Scala" session.
  * The ExternalAPI allows its users to model the Wolf, Sheep and Cabbage puzzle (also known as the Fox, Goose and Bag of Beans puzzle).
  * The ExternalApi contains several issues that you might use a DSL to remedy if the original code is not under your control, such as:
  * - very easy to fumble the setup: the API doesn't enforce a proper setup but DOES expect the user to provide it,
  * - very easy to cheat: commands used during setup could just as easily be used to place creatures or the boat wherever the user pleases at any time,
  * - clumsy validation of the solution,
  * - imperative execution & mutability,
  * - general unfriendlyness towards non-coding readers (such as requiring Option[Creature] as imput)
  * - other issues...
  * (To be clear, it is Intentionally Badâ„¢)
