## Writing a DSL for Dummies with Scala

### Abstract
#### The abstract is the 300 character elevator pitch for this talk.
Writing a good DSL doesn't have to be difficult. Nor do you have to be some kind of coding guru. In this talk I will explain the simple principles and techniques that make Scala an awesome tool for writing a Domain Specific Language and show how to use them to make a user-friendly and powerful DSL.

Sometimes code is cluttered or cumbersome.
Sometimes code needs to be readable for Testers or Business Analysts.
Sometimes they even need to write the code!
Would it not be nice if you could write code that looks almost like natural language?
Would it not be cool if it had auto-completion?
Would it not be great if you could do it without external DSL tooling like ANTLR?
Would it not be awesome if all that is actually _really_ easy?

In DSL for Dummies we will look into the various techniques of writing a clean Domain Specific Language using Scala, a language rather suited for the purpose. The Scala toolbox features a wide range of tools such as: infix notation, postfix operations, implicit arguments and conversions, package objects and even the optional omitting of ugly things like semicolons, brackets and braces. We will show how the proper application of this toolset can lead to a beautiful and flexible DSL. One that provides proper code completion suggestions while shielding the user from confusing inner workings. A DSL that can even be used in good old fashioned Java projects!

No special requirements, just a microphone and a way to display a presentation and enable live coding.
Together we have written an extensive DSL based on a rule engine to enable runnable specifications of calculations by members of the business in scala as well as a DSL to test the runnable specs, so that the business can write both the calculations and the expectations without programmer assistance.

Nathan Perdijk: I am an unapologetic boardgame fanatic, with a rather old cat, a loving wife and a mastersdegree in History and Philosophy of Science (unsorted list). I have only come to the wonderful world of programming just over two years ago, when I decided to change careerpaths and learn Java! Not long after, I was forcefully introduced to the even more wonderful world of Scala to help write an extensive DSL my team was building for financial calculations. I learned Scala's DSL tricks while I was barely a programmer, demonstrating that you do not, in fact, need to be a coding guru to write a good DSL.


## Meta-Programming with Scala Meta: so Meta right now
